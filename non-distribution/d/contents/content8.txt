cultural institution in the United States but also the largest library in the
world in terms of the number of books and shelf space. It was established in
1800, making it an institution rich in history. What makes it particularly

million books and other printed materials in 470 languages, the rough draft of
the Declaration of Independence, a Gutenberg Bible (one of only three perfect
vellum copies known to exist), over 1.7 million recordings, and much more. It's
not just a library; it's a treasure trove of global knowledge and history. The
Library of Congress adds approximately 12,000 items to its collections each day,
emphasizing its ever-growing nature as a repository of human knowledge and
creativity. The library serves as a resource not only for U.S. Congress and
government agencies but also for researchers, scholars, and the general public
worldwide.
