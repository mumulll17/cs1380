INTERESTING FACT A

In the realm of quantum physics, there's a phenomenon known as "quantum
entanglement." This occurs when pairs or groups of particles interact in such a
way that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of
the state of the others, even when the particles are separated by large
distances. What's truly mind-boggling is that a change in the state of one
particle instantly influences the state of the other, regardless of the distance
separating them. This phenomenon was famously described by Albert Einstein as
"spooky action at a distance," and it challenges our classical concepts of space
and causality. Quantum entanglement is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics
and has significant implications for the fields of quantum computing and
cryptography.
